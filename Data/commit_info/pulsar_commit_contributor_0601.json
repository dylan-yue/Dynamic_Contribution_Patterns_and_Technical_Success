        "message": "Use consistent hashing in KeyShared distribution (#6791)\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of KeyShared subscriptions uses a mechanism to divide they hash space across the available consumers. This is based on dividing the currently assigned hash ranges when a new consumer joins or leaves. \r\n\r\nThere are few problems with the current approach:\r\n\r\n 1. When adding a new consumer, the bigger range is split to make space for the new consumer. That means that when adding 3 consumers, 1 of them will \"own\" a hash range that is double in size compared to the other 2 consumers and consequently it will receive twice the traffic. This is not terrible, but not ideal either. \r\n\r\n 2. When removing consumers, the range for the removed consumer will always be assigned to the next consumer. The new hash distribution really depends on the sequence upon which the consumers are removed. If one is unlucky, the traffic will be very heavily skewed having situations where 1 consumer is getting >90% of the traffic.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of removing consumers in sequence, with attached the size of their respective hash ranges:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=8192, c10=4096, c3=4096, c4=8192, c5=4096, c6=8192, c7=16384, c8=8192, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=8192, c10=4096, c4=8192, c5=4096, c6=12288, c7=16384, c8=8192, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=8192, c10=4096, c5=4096, c6=12288, c7=16384, c8=16384, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=8192, c10=8192, c6=12288, c7=16384, c8=16384, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=24576, c10=8192, c6=12288, c7=16384, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=24576, c10=8192, c7=28672, c9=4096}\r\nRemoved consumer from rangeMap: {c1=53248, c10=8192, c9=4096}\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, `c1` will take most of the traffic. \r\n\r\nMost likely it will not be able to process all the messages and the backlog builds up. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n * No functional difference from user perspective\r\n * Use consistent hashing mechanism to assign keys to consumers. This will ensure even distribution without the degradation in the corner cases.\r\n * Number of points in the ring is configurable, default=100. \r\n * Refactored current unit test. The test are currently duplicating the logic of the implementation and checking the a messages is placed on the bucket for one consumer. Of course it works, since it's the same code executed on both sides. But, instead, the test should focus on the contract of the feature: message should arrive in order, there should be \"decent\" sharing of load across consumers.\r\n  * @codelipenghui I've removed the `selectByIndex()`. In my opinion there's absolutely no difference in efficiency/performance as I've also explained on https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/6647#issuecomment-617497271. I'm happy to discuss more about it.",

        "message": "fix consumer fetch message number maps to read entry number bug and expose avgMessagesPerEntry metric (#6719)\n\n### Motivation\r\nwhen consumer send fetch request to broker server, it contains fetch message number telling the server how many messges should be pushed to consumer client. However, the broker server stores data in bookkeeper or broker cache according to entry not single message if producer produce message using batch feature. There is a gap to map the number of message to the number of entry when dealing with consumer fetch request.\r\n\r\nCurrent strategy just using the following calculating formula to deal with those situation:\r\n```\r\nmessagesToRead = Math.min(availablePermits, readBatchSize);\r\n```\r\n`availablePermits` is the number of message the consumer requested, and `readBatchSize` is the max read entry size set in broker.conf\r\n\r\nAssuming `availablePermits` is 1000 and `readBatchSize` is 500, and each entry contains 1000 messages, messagesToRead will be 500 according to this formula. The broker server will read 500 entry, that is `500 * 1000 = 500,000` messages from bookkeeper or broker cache and push `500,000` messages to consumer at one time though the consumer just need 1000 messages, which leading the consumer cost too much memory to store the fetched message, especially when we increase `readBatchSize` to increase bookkeeper read throughput.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nI add an variable `avgMessagesPerEntry` to record average messages stored in one entry. It will update when broker server push message to the consumer using the following calculating formula\r\n```\r\navgMessagesPerEntry = avgMessagePerEntry * avgPercent + (1 - avgPercent) * new Value\r\n```\r\n`avgMessagePerEntry` is the history average message number per entry and `new Value` is the message number per entry in the fetch request the broker read from cache or bookkeeper. `avgPercent` is a final value 0.9, and the value just control the history avgMessagePerEntry decay rate when update new one. The avgMessagePerEntry initial value is 1000.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with consumer fetch request, it will map fetch requst number to entry number according to the following formula:\r\n```\r\nmessagesToRead = Math.min((int) Math.ceil(availablePermits * 1.0 / avgMessagesPerEntry), readBatchSize);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also expose the avgMessagePerEntry static value to consumer stat metric json.",

Having an Abstract implementation allows us to reuse the majority of the code while still being able to customize the Record and processRecord method.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nKafkaConnectSource was split into AbstractKafkaConnectSource with KafkaConnectSource extending the abstract. The processRecord method was made public to allow overriding of the method. The inner class KafkaSourceRecord was also split into an abstract implementation to allow different types of Records.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nThe change should only be a splitting of code with no behavioral changes to the KafkaConnectSource class.",

In addition, we already hold `mutex_` before `failPendingMessages()`, so we need a method to get necessary callbacks without the lock.\r\n    - The 2nd part doesn't and shouldn't acquire `mutex_`, because we don't know how long user provided callbacks may cost.

Therefore there may exist many unused spots when `ProducerQueueIsFull` happened.\r\n\r\nBesides, if a message was too big or failed to be encrypted, `sendAsync` failed immediately but the reserved spot won't be released.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add a `bool` return value to `BatchMessageContainer::sendMessages` to indicate whether the batched message was pushed to producer's queue.\r\n- Add a `bool` return value to `BatchMessageContainer::add` to indicate whether the reserved spot should be released. The spot would be retained only if the first message was batched and not sent immediately. The spot would be released when the batched message was pushed to the queue.\r\n- Test sending a batch with a 2-spots pending message queue, one spot for storing the batched message, another spot for preventing `ProducerQueueIsFull` error.\r\n- Test after all batched messages being sent, whether the reserved spots of producer's queue were  0.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `BatchMessageTest.testSendCallback`, `BatchMessageTest.testPartitionedTopics` and `BasicEndToEndTest.testMessageTooBig`.",

Now, after making `Authentication` transient variable storm always deserializes it as null and authentication fails. Also `Authentication` is a serializable class so, any auth-implementation must be serializable.\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nKeep Authentication param serializable.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nIt fixes pulsar-storm with authentication enabled.",

Create an instance of the LocalRunner class inside a Java class\r\n2. Initialize it like so:\r\n \r\n`FunctionConfig functionConfig = \r\n\t   FunctionConfig.builder()\r\n\t    \t.className(WordCountFunction.class.getName())\r\n\t    \t.maxPendingAsyncRequests(Integer.valueOf(500))\r\n\t    \t.name(\"word-counter\")\r\n\t    \t.runtime(FunctionConfig.Runtime.JAVA)\r\n\t    \t.build()`\r\n\r\n\t  LocalRunner localRunner = \r\n\t    \tLocalRunner.builder()\r\n\t    \t\t.brokerServiceUrl(BROKER_URL)\r\n\t    \t\t.functionConfig(functionConfig)\r\n\t    \t\t.build();`\r\n3. Attach to the process with a debugger and set a breakpoint at line 360 of the LocalRunner class and attempt to step through to line 361\r\n4. See a \"silent\" NullPointerException is thrown in the following call; \r\n`instanceConfig.setMaxPendingAsyncRequests(functionConfig.getMaxPendingAsyncRequests());`  This is because the call to `getMaxPendingAsyncRequests()` returns null, even though I set it to a value in the FunctionConfig\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOne would expect the value I passed in to be set and for the LocalRunner to start the function inside a local thread\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. iOS]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have the code fix and will attach it to this ticket. Basically the issue is that there is a default value for that field inside the FunctionConfig class that is set as a direct assignment. However, since the class is Lombok annotated, that assignment gets ignored AND prevents assignments from occurring inside the builder as well.\r\n\r\nI have removed that assignment, and added an equivalent logic block to the `FunctionConfigUtils.inferMissingArguments` method to set a default value of 1000 if none is provided.",

        "message": "Fix bug that causes delivery of messages to stop on Shared subscription (#6966)\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIf a large number of consumers are repeatedly added or removed from a Shared type subscription, message delivery to consumers may stop occasionally. Message delivery will not resume until we unload the topic or restart the broker.\r\n\r\nWhen I set the log level of the broker to DEBUG, the following log was output while the message delivery was stopped.\r\n\r\n> 17:17:16.425 [pulsar-io-20-6] DEBUG o.a.p.b.s.p.PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers - [persistent://massakam/global/test/pt16-partition-15 / sub1] Cannot schedule next read until previous one is done\r\n\r\nThis means that the variable `havePendingRead` in `PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers` remains true and the reading of new entries has been canceled.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/v2.3.2/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L312-L321\r\n\r\nHowever, as far as I can see the stats-internal of that topic, there are no actual pending read operations. Therefore, it seems that the value of `havePendingRead` is wrong.\r\n```json\r\n\"cursors\" : {\r\n  \"sub1\" : {\r\n    \"markDeletePosition\" : \"2383570:2158\",\r\n    \"readPosition\" : \"2383570:2159\",\r\n    \"waitingReadOp\" : false,\r\n    \"pendingReadOps\" : 0,\r\n    \"messagesConsumedCounter\" : 309909,\r\n    \"cursorLedger\" : 2383013,\r\n    \"cursorLedgerLastEntry\" : 775,\r\n    \"individuallyDeletedMessages\" : \"[]\",\r\n    \"lastLedgerSwitchTimestamp\" : \"2020-05-13T13:10:35.721+09:00\",\r\n    \"state\" : \"Open\",\r\n    \"numberOfEntriesSinceFirstNotAckedMessage\" : 1,\r\n    \"totalNonContiguousDeletedMessagesRange\" : 0,\r\n    \"properties\" : { }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result of the investigation, I found that `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown on the following line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/v2.3.2/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L318\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: null\r\n        at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:127)\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.impl.ManagedCursorImpl.asyncReadEntriesOrWait(ManagedCursorImpl.java:561)\r\n        at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.readMoreEntries(PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java:325)\r\n        at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.lambda$readMoreEntries$2(PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java:255)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.PromiseTask.runTask(PromiseTask.java:98)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.ScheduledFutureTask.run(ScheduledFutureTask.java:170)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.safeExecute(AbstractEventExecutor.java:164)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.runAllTasks(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:472)\r\n        at io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollEventLoop.run(EpollEventLoop.java:384)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:989)\r\n        at io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the value of `messagesToRead` is less than or equal to 0. A value of 0 or less may be assigned to `messagesToRead` in the following part:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/1fd1b2b440af2477f916999a67752f9f532d1620/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L254-L255\r\n\r\nThis method is not synchronized, so `totalAvailablePermits` may be updated by other threads. Therefore, even if `totalAvailablePermits` is greater than 0 on the first line, it may be 0 or less on the second line.\r\n\r\nAs a result, `messagesToRead` becomes 0 or less and `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. When this happens, the callback method is never executed, so `havePendingRead` will never return to false, and message delivery will stop.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFixed the part that causes this bug as follows:\r\n```diff\r\n-if (totalAvailablePermits > 0 && isAtleastOneConsumerAvailable()) {\r\n-    int messagesToRead = Math.min(totalAvailablePermits, readBatchSize);\r\n+int currentTotalAvailablePermits = totalAvailablePermits;\r\n+if (currentTotalAvailablePermits > 0 && isAtleastOneConsumerAvailable()) {\r\n+    int messagesToRead = Math.min(currentTotalAvailablePermits, readBatchSize);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if `messagesToRead` is 0 or less, correct it to 1 before passing it to `ManagedCursorImpl#asyncReadEntriesOrWait()`.",

Rough draft right now.\r\n\r\nAdded changes to show intent behind passing port value to Start in function.go. Also, added some code to support healthcheck and added methods to support instanceConrolServicer. Just needed to commit changes to allow reproducible test errors.

Updated GetInputTopics method to get input topics from the source location. (Should have been part of previous commit.) Also, added expectedHealthCheckInterval to conf.yaml for testing. (#4175).\r\n\r\nFixed license formatting by running mvn license:format (#4175).\r\n\r\nAdded logic and tests to allow healthCheck to kill instances that aren't receiving their regular health checks. Still needs an end-to-end test involving FunctionManager to check for possible issues that could kill instances incorrectly (#4175).\r\n\r\nRemoved inputTopics field from FunctionContext (#4175).\r\n\r\nAdding the progress I've made so far on migrating the Prometheus code to Go... currently blocked due to missing methods from the Go client. Waiting for information from the Prometheus maintainers to find a workaround. (#4175).\r\n\r\nFixed license check.

Needs testing. Also, needs review of specific locations of stats method calls to ensure we're collecting data in the right places. Also, still needs the 1m interval stats to be created. Upstream Prometheus changes prevented us from using the existing approaches for collecting these stats.\r\n\r\n* Improved formatting of Go code.

If it blocked in memtable write, the total AddEntry operation will be blocked, and the 99th AddEntry latency will increase.\r\n\r\nWhen memtable full or checkpoint scheduled by timer, memtable will be swapped with backup one. However, if the backup memtable has not been flushed to disk complete yet, the memtable swap will be blocked, and the `AddEntry` operation will be blocked. So in which situation the backup memtable will be blocked?\r\n\r\nWhen pulsar doing `catch-up read`, large amount of data will be read from ledger disk, and ledger disk io util will increase. At the same time, backup memtable will flush data from PageCache to disk triggered by OS (default is 30s) or rolling file no matter for HDD or SSD. It is hard to control the flush frequency and batch size in each flush cycle. In most cases, the flush batch size of each flush cycle is from 500MB to 1GB, which will lead to the ledger disk io util to 100% from 1s to 10s+, especially when large amount of read from the ledger disk in the same time.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn order to decrease ledger disk high io util duration, we can control the backup memtable flush batch size from pageCache to disk. In my practice, the flush batch set to 256MB may perform better for HDD disk.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest adjust the default configuration `FlushEntryLogBytes` to 256MB in bookkeeper.conf to increase bookie io throughput.",

The V2 version of the endpoint returns the actual list of functions in the namespace. It looks like during the switch from V2 to V3, the implementation for the endpoint was missed. This endpoint is part of the current API [documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/functions-rest-api/?version=2.5.0#operation/listFunctions), so I don't think it was removed intentionally.\r\n\r\nThis endpoint is also used by the pulsar-admin command, so that always returns 404:\r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar-admin functions list --tenant chris-kafkaesque-io --namespace local-useast2-aws\r\nHTTP 404 Not Found\r\n\r\nReason: HTTP 404 Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nI have added the endpoint to `FunctionsApiV3Resource.java`.

When messages are sent to the JDBC sink without that field, an exception like this is seen:\r\n\r\n```\r\n21:08:38.472 [pool-5-thread-1] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.io.jdbc.JdbcAbstractSink - Got exception \r\njava.sql.SQLException: Data truncated for column 'example' at row 1\r\n\tat com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLError.createSQLException(SQLError.java:127) ~[mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar:8.0.11]\r\n\tat com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLError.createSQLException(SQLError.java:95) ~[mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar:8.0.11]\r\n\tat com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.SQLExceptionsMapping.translateException(SQLExceptionsMapping.java:122) ~[mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar:8.0.11]\r\n\tat com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ClientPreparedStatement.executeInternal(ClientPreparedStatement.java:960) ~[mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar:8.0.11]\r\n\tat com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ClientPreparedStatement.execute(ClientPreparedStatement.java:388) ~[mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar:8.0.11]\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.io.jdbc.JdbcAbstractSink.flush(JdbcAbstractSink.java:202) ~[pulsar-io-jdbc-2.5.0.nar-unpacked/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.io.jdbc.JdbcAbstractSink.lambda$open$0(JdbcAbstractSink.java:108) ~[pulsar-io-jdbc-2.5.0.nar-unpacked/:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511) [?:1.8.0_232]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.runAndReset(FutureTask.java:308) [?:1.8.0_232]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$ScheduledFutureTask.access$301(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:180) [?:1.8.0_232]\r\n```\r\nLooking at the code for the JDBC sink, there was no handling of the case where the field was `null`.

        "message": "Add ThresholdShedder Strategy for loadbalancer and expose loadbalance metric to prometheus (#6772)\n\n### Motivation\r\nThe Only one overload shedder strategy is `OverloadShedder`, which collects each broker's max resource usage and compare with threshold (default value is 85%). When max resource usage reaches the threshold, it will trigger bundle unloading, which will migrate parts of bundles to other brokers. The overload shedder strategy has some drawbacks as follows:\r\n- Not support configure other overload shedder strategies\r\n- It is hard to determine the threshold value,  the default threshold is 85%. But for a broker, the max resource usage is few to reach 85%, which will lead to unbalanced traffic between brokers. The heavy traffic broker's read cache hit rate will decrease.\r\n- When you restart the most brokers of the pulsar cluster at the same time, the whole traffic in the cluster will goes to the rest brokers. The restarted brokers will have no traffic for a long time, due to the rest brokers max resource usage not reach the threshold.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Support multiple overload shedder strategy, which only need to configure in `broker.conf`\r\n2. I develop `ThresholdShedder` strategy, the main idea as follow:\r\n    - Calculate the average resource usage of the brokers, and individual broker resource usage will compare with the average value. If it greatter than average value plus threshold, the overload shedder will be triggered.\r\n    `broker resource usage > average resource usage + threshold`\r\n    - Each kind of resources (ie bandwithIn, bandwithOut, CPU, Memory, Direct Memory), has weight(default is 1.0) when calculate broker's resource usage.\r\n    - Record the pulsar broker cluster history average resource usage, new average resource usage will be calculate as follow:\r\n    `new_avg = old_avg * factor + (1-factor) * avg`\r\n    `new_avg`: newest average resoruce usage\r\n    `old_avg`: old average resource usge which is calculate in last round.\r\n    `factor`: the decrease factor, default value is `0.9`\r\n    `avg`: the average resource usage of the brokers\r\n3. expose load balance metric to prometheus\r\n4. fix a bug in `OverloadShedder`, which specify the unloaded bundle in the overload's own broker.\r\n\r\nPlease help check this implementation, if it is ok, i will add test case.",

        "message": "[pulsar-client] Add support to load tls certs/key dynamically from inputstream (#6760)\n\n### Motivation\r\nRight now, Pulsar-client provides tls authentication support and default TLS provider `AuthenticationTls` expects file path of cert and key files. However, there are usescases where it will be difficult for user-applications to store certs/key file locally for tls authentication.\r\neg:\r\n1. Applications running on docker or K8s containers will not have certs at defined location and app uses KMS or various key-vault system whose API return streams of certs.\r\n2. Operationally hard to manage key rotation in containers\r\n3. Need to avoid storing key/trust store files on file system for stronger security\r\n\r\nTherefore, it's good to have mechanism in default `AuthenticationTls` provider to read certs from memory/stream without storing certs on file-system.\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\nAdd Stream support in `AuthenticationTls` to provide X509Certs and PrivateKey which also performs auto-refresh when stream changes in a given provider.\r\n```\r\nAuthenticationTls auth = new AuthenticationTls(certStreamProvider, keyStreamProvider);\r\n```\r\nIt will be also address: #5241",

        "message": "[Issue #6711]: add audience verify in AuthenticationProviderToken (#6716)\n\nFixes #6711\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nUser like to be able to configure the JWT authentication provider to verify the audience on incoming tokens.  I believe this will improve security because it would prevent a spoofer from reusing a token that was intended for another purpose (yet signed by the same issuer).  [RFC 6749 section 4.1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3) has some guidance on this.  In my scenario, the token is an OAuth 2.0 token, and OAuth 2.0 makes extensive use of the audience claim ([ref](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/guides/validate-access-tokens#check-additional-standard-claims)).\r\n\r\n1. a configurable audience claim name (e.g. `aud`).\r\n2. if audience isn't configured, do not validate the audience (for back-compatibility).\r\n3. if audience is configured, validate that the value is present in the token.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- Add the logic in AuthenticationProviderToken.\r\n- Add related tests.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n- Ut passed",

E.g. `[docs] Fix typo in produce method`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #6448\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many online business systems, various exceptions usually occur in business logic processing, so the message needs to be re-consumed, but users hope that this delay time can be controlled flexibly. The current user's processing method is usually to send this message to a special retry topic, because production can specify any delay, so consumers subscribe the business topic and retry topic at the same time. I think this logic can be supported by pulsar itself, making it easier for users to use, and it looks like this is a very common requirement.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis change can be supported on the client side,  need to add a set of interfaces to org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Consumer\r\n```java\r\nvoid reconsumeLater(Message<?> message, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit) throws PulsarClientException;\r\nCompletableFuture<Void> reconsumeLaterAsync(Message<?> message, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);\r\nCompletableFuture<Void> reconsumeLaterAsync(Messages<?> messages, int delayLevel);\r\n```\r\nDeadLetterPolicy add retry topic\r\n```java\r\npublic class DeadLetterPolicy {\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Maximum number of times that a message will be redelivered before being sent to the dead letter queue.\r\n     */\r\n    private int maxRedeliverCount;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Name of the retry topic where the failing messages will be sent.\r\n     */\r\n    private String retryLetterTopic;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Name of the dead topic where the failing messages will be sent.\r\n     */\r\n    private String deadLetterTopic;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.client.impl.ConsumerImpl add a retry producer\r\n```java\r\n  private volatile Producer<T> deadLetterProducer;\r\n\r\n  private volatile Producer<T> retryLetterProducer;\r\n```\r\nCan specify whether to enable retry when creating a consumer，default unenable\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public ConsumerBuilder<T> enableRetry(boolean retryEnable) {\r\n        conf.setRetryEnable(retryEnable);\r\n        return this;\r\n    }\r\n```",

Support of json schema is added in this pull request.\r\n\r\nThe sink for influxdbv1 requires  influxdb fields as schema fields, so users should define schemas for each kind of device, that is not convenient.  The new added sink for influxdbv2 redefines the message schema, and wraps influxdb 'fields' in one map field, just like 'tags' which is already defined as map in the previous sink for influxdbv1.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n  - Unit tests are added for this sink for influxdbv2.",

However, 2.4 release has change #4196 which restarts broker on OOM which can cause huge instability in cluster where that topic moves from one broker to another and restarts multiple brokers and cause disruption for other topics as well. we have seen similar kind of issue mentioned at  #5896 . This could be transient error and we need a way to ignore this error. So, we need a dynamic flag to skip broker shutdown on OOM to avoid instability in a cluster.\r\n```\r\n01:48:49.549 [pulsar-io-22-37] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.PulsarBrokerStarter - -- Shutting down - Received OOM exception: Direct buffer memory\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory\r\n        at java.nio.Bits.reserveMemory(Bits.java:175) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.<init>(DirectByteBuffer.java:118) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(ByteBuffer.java:317) ~[?:?]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena$DirectArena.allocateDirect(PoolArena.java:769) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena$DirectArena.newChunk(PoolArena.java:745) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocateNormal(PoolArena.java:244) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocate(PoolArena.java:226) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PoolArena.allocate(PoolArena.java:146) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.PooledByteBufAllocator.newDirectBuffer(PooledByteBufAllocator.java:324) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBufAllocator.directBuffer(AbstractByteBufAllocator.java:185) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.common.allocator.impl.ByteBufAllocatorImpl.newDirectBuffer(ByteBufAllocatorImpl.java:164) ~[bookkeeper-common-allocator-4.9.4.2-yahoo.jar:4.9.4.2-yahoo]\r\n        at org.apache.bookkeeper.common.allocator.impl.ByteBufAllocatorImpl.newDirectBuffer(ByteBufAllocatorImpl.java:158) ~[bookkeeper-common-allocator-4.9.4.2-yahoo.jar:4.9.4.2-yahoo]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBufAllocator.directBuffer(AbstractByteBufAllocator.java:185) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBufAllocator.directBuffer(AbstractByteBufAllocator.java:176) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.allocate(SslHandler.java:1912) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.allocateOutNetBuf(SslHandler.java:1923) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.wrap(SslHandler.java:826) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.wrapAndFlush(SslHandler.java:797) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.handler.ssl.SslHandler.flush(SslHandler.java:778) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:776) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:768) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.flush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:749) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter.flush(ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter.java:115) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeFlush0(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:776) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeWriteAndFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:802) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.write(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:814) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.writeAndFlush(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:794) ~[netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.Consumer.lambda$sendMessages$51(Consumer.java:265) ~[pulsar-broker-2.4.6-yahoo.jar:2.4.6-yahoo]\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.AbstractEventExecutor.safeExecute(AbstractEventExecutor.java:163) [netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.Final]\r\n        at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor.runAllTasks(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:404) [netty-all-4.1.32.Final.jar:4.1.32.\r\n:\r\n: \r\n01:48:49.549 [pulsar-io-22-39] ERROR org.apache.pulsar.PulsarBrokerStarter -

You may keep `autoTopicCreation` disabled for the broker and allow it on a specific namespace using this feature.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add new namespace policy: `autoTopicCreationOverride` and associated API / CLI interface for setting and removing. Defaults to non-partitioned type, but also allows partitioned topics.\r\n- Modifies BrokerService: when checking `autoTopicCreation` configuration, the broker first retrieves namespace policies from zookeeper. If the `autoTopicCreationOverride` policy exists for that namespace then it uses those settings. If not, falls back to broker configuration.\r\n- Slight refactor to move `TopicType` enum to pulsar-common and add `autoTopicCreationOverride` to pulsar-common.",

For example https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/functions/worker/PulsarFunctionE2ESecurityTest.java#L630, the test checks the properties of the message are forwarded, but we don't call `functionConfig.setForwardSourceMessageProperty(true)`, the reason is #6318 introduce `forwardSourceMessageProperty ` to enable or disable message properties forward in functions. But the default value is false, this will break previous behavior. So this PR set it to true to keep forward compatible.\r\n\r\nAnd getApiException method (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-client-admin/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/admin/internal/BaseResource.java#L235) is very confusing, this will cause the async function admin method that #6580 introduced can't complete when met exceptions. \r\n\r\nBTW,  I have no idea why #6318 and #6580 can pass the CI check. This test is there long ago.",

(#6485)\n\n\r\nFixes #6482\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nPrevent topic compaction from leaking direct memory\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nSeveral leaks were discovered using Netty leak detection and code review.\r\n* `CompactedTopicImpl.readOneMessageId` would get an `Enumeration` of `LedgerEntry`, but did not release the underlying buffers. Fix: iterate though the `Enumeration` and release underlying buffer. Instead of logging the case where the `Enumeration` did not contain any elements, complete the future exceptionally with the message (will be logged by Caffeine).\r\n* Two main sources of leak in `TwoPhaseCompactor`. The `RawBacthConverter.rebatchMessage` method failed to close/release a `ByteBuf` (uncompressedPayload). Also, the return ByteBuf of `RawBacthConverter.rebatchMessage` was not closed. The first one was easy to fix (release buffer), to fix the second one and make the code easier to read, I decided to not let `RawBacthConverter.rebatchMessage`  close the message read from the topic, instead the message read from the topic can be closed in a try/finally clause surrounding most of the method body handing a message from a topic (in phase two loop). Then if a new message was produced by `RawBacthConverter.rebatchMessage` we check that after we have added the message to the compact ledger and release the message.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nModified `RawReaderTest.testBatchingRebatch` to show new contract.\r\n\r\nOne can run the test described to reproduce the issue, to verify no leak is detected.",

(#6406)\n\nMotivation\r\nAvro schemas are quite important for proper data flow and it is a pity that the #3762 issue stayed untouched for so long. There were some workarounds on how to make Pulsar use an original avro schema, but in the end, it is pretty hard to run an enterprise solution on workarounds. With this PR I would like to find a solution to the problem caused by shading avro in pulsar-client. As it was discussed in the issue, there are two possible solutions for this problem:\r\n\r\nUnshade the avro library in the pulsar-client library. (IMHO it seems like a proper solution for this problem, but it also brings a risk of unknown side-effects)\r\nUse reflection to get original schemas from generated classes. (I went for this solution)\r\nCould you please comment if this is a proper solution for the problem? I will add tests when my approach will be confirmed.\r\n\r\nModifications\r\nFirst, we try to extract an original avro schema from the \"$SCHEMA\" field using reflection. If it doesn't work, the process falls back generation of the schema from POJO.",

At first I thought it was a copy/paste error. So I created #6338;\r\n\r\nThen I looked into the details how these env-vars[ were used](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/28875d5abc4cd13a3e9cc4f59524d2566d9f9f05/conf/bkenv.sh#L36), found out its ok to use `PULSAR_MEM` as an alternative. But it introduce problems:\r\n1. Since `BOOKIE_GC` was not defined , the default [BOOKIE_EXTRA_OPTS](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/28875d5abc4cd13a3e9cc4f59524d2566d9f9f05/conf/bkenv.sh#L39)  will finally use default value of `BOOKIE_GC`, thus would cover same the JVM parameters defined prior in `PULSAR_MEM`.\r\n2. May cause problems when bootstrap scripts changed in later dev, better to make it explicitly.\r\n\r\nSo I create this pr to solve above problems(hidden trouble).\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, I've made such modifications below:\r\n1. make `BOOKIE_MEM` and `BOOKIE_GC` explicit in `values-mini.yaml` file.  Keep up with the format in`values.yaml` file.\r\n2. remove all  print-gc-logs related args. Considering the resource constraints of minikube environment. The removed part's content is `-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime -XX:+PrintHeapAtGC -verbosegc -XX:G1LogLevel=finest`\r\n3. leave `PULSAR_PREFIX_dbStorage_rocksDB_blockCacheSize` empty as usual, as [conf/standalone.conf#L576](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/df152109415f2b10dd83e8afe50d9db7ab7cbad5/conf/standalone.conf#L576) says it would to use 10% of the direct memory size by default.",

It would be much better if this process would be automated.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution:\r\nAutomate this process via helm install and update the helm charts with templates.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nI've added an additional `functionsAsPods` filed in extra components inside the values file. If the setting is set to `yes`, then it would add `serviceAccount` to the broker deployment. It will also add the rbac policy to give the brokers permissions to deploy functions. The policies can be found in the new `broker-rbac.yaml` template file. Moreover, it will also change the `functions_worker` settings and set the function runtime factory setting that can be found inside `broker-configmap.yaml`.\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n1) Set `functionsAsPods: yes` inside helm values yaml file.\r\n2) Follow the instructions on how deploying helm and run:\r\n`helm install pulsar --values pulsar/values-mini.yaml ./pulsar/`. \r\n3) Wait until all the services are up and running.\r\n4) Set up tenant, namespace.\r\n5) Create a function, sink and source and submit it using the CLI to make sure the pods are running alongside the Pulsar cluster. In addition, set up such a flow where the data is flowing from source to topics, the processed by a function and sink outputs the data\r\n6) Push data into cluster through the source and make sure it comes out of the sink into destination. There shouldn't be any errors in the logs of brokers, bookie, sources, sinks and functions.\r\n\r\n#### Modules affected:\r\nThe changes in the PR are affecting the deployment using the helm charts. Now the if the flag `functionsAsPods` is set to `yes` inside the `values.yaml. file, the functions would run as pods.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nCurrently, the documentations explaining the helm chart deployment process is lacking and this should be updated.",

The other solutions are to expose Grafana as NodePort or setting it as a LoadBalancer.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nAdded `grafana-ingress.yaml` template in the templates and an `ingress` section for Grafana in the values file.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n1) Set ingress to `true` for Grafana in values file and provide hostname. Currently tested with NGINX, but can use another ingress controller, but will need to change the ingress controller class to another one in the template.\r\n\r\n2) Add NGINX Helm repository :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhelm repo add nginx-stable https://helm.nginx.com/stable\r\nhelm repo update\r\n```\r\n3) Install with Helm 3:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhelm install nginix-ingress-crl nginx-stable/nginx-ingress\r\n```\r\n\r\n4) Follow the instructions on how deploying helm and run:\r\n`helm install pulsar --values pulsar/values-mini.yaml ./pulsar/`. \r\n\r\n5) Wait until all the services are up and running.\r\n\r\n6) Verify that Grafana is accessible via url.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Path settings**\r\n\r\nCurrently, by default the path setting is set to `/grafana`. For that to work, the NGINX configuration file `nginx.conf` should have `grafana` sub path enabled:\r\n```    \r\nSee https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/behind_proxy/\r\n\r\nTo avoid having to mess with NGINX configurations files `path` can be changed to `/`, but this path might conflict with other services that are being proxied in the cluster.\r\n\r\n#### Modules affected:\r\nThe changes in the PR are affecting the deployment using the helm charts. Now the if the flag `functionsAsPods` is set to `yes` inside the `values.yaml. file, the functions would run as pods.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThis PR will be adding ingress capability for Grafana and this should be documented.",

Check if any message is available before compaction phases, and finish the compaction immediately if there is no messages to read to avoid timeout exception.\r\n2. Add missing check for empty batch message for the condition to end the phase 2 loop.\r\n3.

This is caused by the fact that the bookie environment variables `BOOKIE_MEM` and `BOOKIE_FC` defined in conf/bkenv.sh has no effect, and it is always using the defaults values. \r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution:\r\nSet `BOOKIE_MEM` and `BOOKIE_GC` in the helm deployments charts and default to `PULSAR_MEM` if the `BOOKIE` settings are not set and then use the default settings if none of those environment variables are set.\r\n\r\n#### Changes made\r\nHelm chart deployment `values.yaml` and `values-mini.yaml` along with the `bkenv.sh` configuration script.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nCurrently, the documentation explaining the deployment process and how to change settings is lacking and need to be updated.",

        "message": "Fix bug that backlog message that has not yet expired could be deleted due to TTL (#6211)\n\nFixes #5579 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn Pulsar 2.4.1 and later versions, if message TTL is enabled, `PersistentMessageExpiryMonitor` always deletes one non-expired message every 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this bug is https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4744. `PersistentMessageExpiryMonitor` expects `ManagedCursor#asyncFindNewestMatching()` to pass null as its found position to itself as a callback if no expired messages exist.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/c5ba52983fee994de61984aae7d1757e9b738caf/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentMessageExpiryMonitor.java#L119-L130\r\n\r\nHowever, due to the change in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4744, if no entry is found that matches the search condition, the callback will be passed `startPosition` instead of null now. For this reason, the earliest backlog message is always deleted by `PersistentMessageExpiryMonitor`.\r\n\r\nThis means that unexpected message loss can occur.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nRevert the https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4744 changes. The motivation of https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4744 is to avoid NPE caused in pulse-sql, but that seems to be fixed in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/4757.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/2069f761753940ed6a1faca8999af70036f20fd6/pulsar-sql/presto-pulsar/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/sql/presto/PulsarSplitManager.java#L363-L382",

In our environment, we need to emit on different streams based on the content of each received message. This change extends `PulsarSpout` to recognize a `Values` extension that specifies an alternate output stream, and uses that stream when given.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nA new `PulsarTuple` class is added. It extends `Values` and adds a method to return the output stream.\r\n\r\nWhen emitting a tuple after calling `toValues(msg)`, `PulsarSpout` checks if the returned `Values` is a `PulsarTuple`. If so, it emits to the designated stream, otherwise it emits as before.",

        "message": "Upgrade Avro to 1.9.1 (#5938)\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Pulsar uses Avro 1.8.2, a version released two years ago. The latest version of Avro is 1.9.1, which uses FasterXML's Jackson 2.x instead of Codehaus's Jackson 1.x. Jackson is prone to security issues, so we should not keep using older versions.\r\nhttps://blog.godatadriven.com/apache-avro-1-9-release\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAvro 1.9 has some major changes:\r\n\r\n- The library used to handle logical datetime values has changed from Joda-Time to JSR-310 (https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/631)\r\n- Namespaces no longer include \"$\" when generating schemas containing inner classes using ReflectData (https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/283)\r\n- Validation of default values has been enabled (https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/288). This results in a validation error when parsing the following schema:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"fieldName\",\r\n  \"type\": [\r\n    \"null\",\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"default\": \"defaultValue\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe default value of a nullable field must be null (cf. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1803), and the default value of the field as above is actually null. However, this PR disables the validation in order to maintain the traditional behavior.",

However, if the interval between these message IDs is long, the message IDs may be added to other elements of `timePartitions`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/09360682953d0cbc154630a470492c11a4f83184/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/UnAckedMessageTracker.java#L163-L172\r\n\r\nAs a result, even if the consumer sends ack, some message IDs remain without being deleted from `timePartitions`, and an unnecessary ack timeout event occurs.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nWhen adding a message ID to `UnAckedMessageTracker`, check if the same message ID is already included in` timePartitions`, and if it is included, do nothing.",

That was done intentionally to get around the website indexing issue. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Pulsar's website indexing uses the **Algolia** framework, which takes some time. In Apache Pulsar 2.4.1,  users are complaining the website search is broken, this is the problem.\r\n\r\nSo in release 2.4.2, we published 2.4.2 documentation but didn't promote it as the current stable. We will make sure the  **Algolia** index works before moving 2.4.2 as the current stable.\r\n\r\nIn next release, we can think about how to improve the website update process for a release.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Update website stable version to 2.4.2",

Dispatch-throttling feature allows user to configure absolute dispatch rate based on current publish-rate for a given topic or subscriber, and broker will make sure to dispatch only configured number of messages to the consumers regardless current publish-rate or backlog on that topic.\r\n\r\nCurrent dispatch-rate limiting doesn't consider change in publish-rate so, increasing publish-rate on the topic might be larger than configured dispatch-rate which will cause backlog on the topic and consumers will never be able to catch up the backlog unless user again reconfigured the dispatch-rate based on current publish-rate. Reconfiguring dispatch-rate based on publish-rate requires human interaction and monitoring. Therefore, we need a mechanism to configure dispatch rate relative to the current publish-rate on the topic.\r\n\r\n### Modification\r\n`set-dispatch-rate` cli have a flag `--relative-to-publish-rate` to enable relative dispatch throttling.\r\n\r\n```\r\npulsar-admin namespaces <property/cluster/namespace> set-dispatch-rate --msg-dispatch-rate 1000 --relative-to-publish-rate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nI will add broker-level configuration and documentation into separate PR.",

This interface is intended, as the name indicates, allows for\r\ncustomizing how the kubernetes manifests are generated before they\r\nare sent off to the k8s cluster. \r\n\r\nThis interface has a default implementation, which allows for\r\nchanging the namespace, labels, nodeSelector labels, and toleratations per function.\r\n\r\nThis interface is also pluggable, allowing for more customized\r\nimplementations. For example, the functions for a given tenant could be\r\nmapped to different pools of compute for isolation.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFor the CLI and protobufs, the modifications just involve plumbing through the new option, `customRuntimeOptions` through the relevant code. \r\n\r\nFor kubernetes runtime, the modifications are fairly straight forward, adding a new configuration option, `kubernetesManifestCustomizerClassName` and `kubernetesManifestCustomizerConfig` which are options under the kubernetes runtime.",

This means\r\nthat once a user reads an entry, we should expect that the next entry\r\nthey read will be the next entry in the ledger.\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of the BlobStoreBackedReadHandleImpl (and\r\nthe S3 variant that preceeded it) didn't take this into\r\naccount. Instead it did a lookup in the index each time, to find the\r\nblock that contained the entry, and then read forward in the block\r\nuntil it found the entry requested. This is fine for the first few\r\nentries in the block, not so much for the last.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the read behaviour to only seek if entryId read\r\nfrom the block is either:\r\n- greater than the entry we were expecting to read, in which case we\r\n  need to seek backwards in the block.\r\n- less than the entry expected, but also belonging to a different\r\n  block to the expected entry, in which case we need to seek to the\r\n  correct block.\r\n\r\nThis change improves read performance significantly. Adhoc benchmarks\r\nshows that we can read from offloaded topics at ~160MB/s whereas\r\npreviously we could only manage <10MB/s.\r\n\r\n* Revert it back to debug",

Enhanced fan-out can also be disabled and fall back to\r\na polling model.\r\n\r\nNote, this also bumps the kinesis-producer to v0.13, which moves to an\r\nAPL license (but has no other changes) to make this nicer to use in\r\nan Apache project without license concerns.\r\n\r\n* Add included providers for kinesis auth\r\n\r\nThis adds two providers for Kinesis auth. First, the\r\nAwsDefaultProviderChain, which just uses the default provider chain\r\nwhich will pull from env vars, system configuration files, and the\r\nmetadata API.\r\n\r\nSecond, the STSAssumeRole plugin allows us to assume a role (which first\r\nrelies on the default provider chain) to run the code under a given role\r\n\r\n* add some docs and minor cleanup",

This can be reproduced with the following procedure:\r\n\r\n1. Connect multiple consumers to a subscription in Failover mode\r\n1. Reset the subscription cursor to a past position\r\n1. Close some consumers\r\n1. The remaining consumers may not receive new messages from the topic\r\n\r\nAt this time, the active consumer is already closed one:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"subscriptions\" : {\r\n  \"sub1\" : {\r\n    \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n    \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n    \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n    \"msgBacklog\" : 57604,\r\n    \"blockedSubscriptionOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n    \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n    \"type\" : \"Failover\",\r\n    \"activeConsumerName\" : \"04b6c\", // This consumer is already closed!\r\n    \"msgRateExpired\" : 0.0,\r\n    \"consumers\" : [ {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"consumerName\" : \"06317b\",\r\n      \"availablePermits\" : 564,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n      \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"metadata\" : { },\r\n      \"connectedSince\" : \"2019-09-11T18:56:25.413+09:00\",\r\n      \"clientVersion\" : \"2.3.2\",\r\n      \"address\" : \"/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:36968\"\r\n    }, {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"consumerName\" : \"37edc\",\r\n      \"availablePermits\" : 1000,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n      \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"metadata\" : { },\r\n      \"connectedSince\" : \"2019-09-11T18:56:27.77+09:00\",\r\n      \"clientVersion\" : \"2.3.2\",\r\n      \"address\" : \"/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:38392\"\r\n    }, {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"consumerName\" : \"822f0\",\r\n      \"availablePermits\" : 1000,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n      \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"metadata\" : { },\r\n      \"connectedSince\" : \"2019-09-11T18:56:27.769+09:00\",\r\n      \"clientVersion\" : \"2.3.2\",\r\n      \"address\" : \"/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:38380\"\r\n    }, {\r\n      \"msgRateOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgThroughputOut\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"msgRateRedeliver\" : 0.0,\r\n      \"consumerName\" : \"b91282\",\r\n      \"availablePermits\" : 1000,\r\n      \"unackedMessages\" : 0,\r\n      \"blockedConsumerOnUnackedMsgs\" : false,\r\n      \"metadata\" : { },\r\n      \"connectedSince\" : \"2019-09-11T18:56:25.413+09:00\",\r\n      \"clientVersion\" : \"2.3.2\",\r\n      \"address\" : \"/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:38408\"\r\n    } ]\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `AbstractDispatcherSingleActiveConsumer#closeFuture` is not null, so `pickAndScheduleActiveConsumer()` is not called and the active consumer does not change.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/8c3445ad6746df93fef80d2c661374cdab00bc38/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/AbstractDispatcherSingleActiveConsumer.java#L181-L184\r\n\r\n`closeFuture` becomes non-null when `disconnectAllConsumers()` is called.

If there is a better method, please let me know.\r\n\r\nI just verified it in the following way:\r\n```\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sources available-sources\r\nmv pulsar-io-debezium-mysql-2.4.0.nar ./connectors\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sources reload\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sources available-sources\r\n\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks available-sinks\r\nmv pulsar-io-jdbc-2.4.0.nar ./connectors\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks reload\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks available-sinks\r\n```",

        "message": "Adding back Prometheus TYPE definitions; fixed duplicate TYPE errors; fixed format issue in metricWithRemoteCluster; added test for Prometheus types (#4183)\n\nFixes #3112 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, I set out to fix #3112, which is caused by duplicate TYPE statements in the metrics output which leads to parsing of Prometheus metrics to fail in recent versions of Prometheus. Because of this, Prometheus will report the broker target as down.\r\n\r\nSince I started looking at this, the type definitions have been removed (#4136) from topics metric output. I think these types are useful in Prometheus and have added them back in. \r\n\r\nWhile testing this fix in my geo-replicated setup, I found a format in error (missing quote and comma) in the TopicStats.metricWithRemoteCluster method. This pull request includes a fix for that issue.\r\n\r\nI have also added a new test to PrometheusMetricsTest.java that fails without these changes but passed with them.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nI added a static HashMap to TopicStats to keep track of the TYPEs that have been output. All writing of the TYPE for topics and namespaces is done with the TopicStats.metricType method. I modified that method to update the HashMap and only print the TYPE out for the first occurrence of the metric name.  I also added a method reset the HashMap, which gets called in NamespaceStatsAggregator.generate. \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added testDuplicateMetricTypeDefinitions which checks for:\r\n       - duplicate TYPE definitions in the Prometheus output\r\n       - validates that no TYPE definition appears after the first metric sample\r\n       - ensures that all metrics have a defined type\r\n\r\nI execute the test twice to make sure the resetting of the HashMap of the already seen metric type definitions works correctly. This test passes for me reliably (both occurrences).\r\n\r\nI have confirmed using promtool that the metrics output will now parse without error using versions 2.7.1 and 2.9.2 (which is the latest). There are many warnings around missing HELP definitions and metrics using reserved suffixes (ex. _count), but no errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have patched 2.3.1 with this fix and am currently running it in my cluster. Prometheus (2.7.1) successfully parses the metrics and I am able to see namespace and topic-level metrics.",

Stop return partition name in table list, just return the partitioned topic name in table list. This will avoid huge tables while user create large number of partition.\r\n2. Make partition as internal column, provide users with the ability to get which partition data in and filtration based on partition. For example: \r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM \"my-table\" WHERE \"__partition__\" = 0;\r\nSELECT * FROM \"my-table\" WHERE \"__partition__\" in (2,3);\r\nSELECT * FROM \"my-table\" WHERE \"__partition__\" < 1;\r\n```\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Add \"__partition__\" internal column.\r\n2. Add domain handle for \"__partition__\".\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test to verify this change\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If `yes` was chosen, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API: (yes)\r\n  - The schema: (no)\r\n  - The default values of configurations: (no)\r\n  - The wire protocol: ( no)\r\n  - The rest endpoints: (no)\r\n  - The admin cli options: (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment: (no)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Reference an exact element of MessageContainer explicitly from outside by iteration operator;\r\n2. Reference the `sendCallback_` function pointer of said MessageContainer element explicitly from outside;\r\n3. Reference the `message_` member of said MessageContainer element explicitly from outside;\r\n\r\nBesides,  there is only one incoming variable say `Result r` is given from outside; \r\n\r\nIn an ideal design, a user of `MessageContainer` should not have to know exactly the existence of `MessageContainer::sendCallback_` or `MessageContainer::message_`, what they exactly are, either how to use them.  Organize those stuff in a right way, should be the responsibility of struct `MessageContainer` itself.\r\n\r\nSo a reasonable convenient invoking method should be like:\r\n`MessageContainerList::iterator iter = messagesContainerListPtr->begin();`\r\n`iter->callBack(r);`\r\n\r\nAnd said `MessageContainer::callBack` function shall be implemented like below:\r\n`void callBack(const pulsar::Result& r) { sendCallback_(r, message_); }`\r\n\r\nObviously, said convenient method is also an efficient one.\r\n\r\nMoreover, use a more efficient iteration method while going through the MessageContainerList; \r\nFrom some benchmark test result in my local environment, such \"for iteration based a fixed-length\", will be 5 times faster than the STL::iterator operator way. \r\n\r\nRefer to the change on BatchMessageContainer.cc, please.",

This lead to use 20MB per partition even when no message is tracked.\r\n\r\nAllowing to configure the tick time so that application can tune it based on needs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, fixed the logic that keeps creating hash maps and throwing them away at each tick time iteration, since that creates a lot of garbage and doesn't take care of the fact that the hash maps are expanding based on the required capacity (so next time they are already of the \"right\" size). \r\n\r\nOn a final note: the current default of 1sec seems very wasteful.

It would be hard to debug user's topology without enough information so, adding two metrics which can impact spout throughput.\r\n- number of message filed: spout sleeps when it sees failed message so, it's important to have visibility of that count\r\n- number of times spout-thread not found the message in queue: spout topology internally sleeps if it doesn't see any emitted tuple in collector after triggering `nextTuple()` api.\r\n\r\nThis metrics gives more visibility about consumer throughput.",

This PR introduces support for WS producers to be able to optionally provide such property.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nThe change impacts 2 packages:\r\n1. `pulsar-common`: within the utilities that this package provides, there's the `DateFormatter` which is used by the WS consumer API to format both the `eventTime` an the `publishTime`. The method `parse(String datetime)` is added to do the reverse process of `format(long timestamp)`. The method was added to this class as it's very close to it's functionality and depends on a private property that already contains proper timezone management.\r\n2. `pulsar-websocket`: the `eventTime` property is added to `ProducerMessage` class for adequate mapping as a string. If the property is not null when processing the message (`ProducerHandler.onWebSocketText()`) and the parsing fails, a `FailedToDeserializeFromJSON` error is returned (I didn't want to introduce a new type of error); if parsing is successful, the provided `eventTime` is converted to milliseconds and passed to the builder.",

It still uses `ConcurrentLongPairSet` to avoid object allocation for message-ids.\r\n- introduce `<T> Set<T> items(int numberOfItems, BiFunction<Long, Long, T> longPairConverter)` method  in `LongPairSet` to avoid creating temporary [LongPair](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L291) objects.\r\n- this change will not impact to normal usecase where topic doesn't have backlog and doesn't have many active managed-ledgers.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nI have done performance testing on `GrowablePriorityLongPairQueue` which I had introduced sometime back but its insert/remove is super slow and CPU intensive so, we can't use it in this scenario.",

It makes AUTO_CONSUME less useful in some use cases,\r\nsuch as CDC. Because there is no way for the applications to know which version of schema\r\nthat a message is using.\r\n\r\nIn order to support multi-version schema, we need to propagate schema version from\r\nmessage header through schema#decode method to the decoded record.\r\n\r\n*Modifications*\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new decode method `decode(byte[] data, byte[] schemaVersion)`. This allows the implementation\r\n  to leverage the schema version.\r\n- Introduce a method `supportSchemaVersioning` to tell which decode methods to use. Because most of the schema\r\n  implementations such as primitive schemas and POJO based schema doesn't make any sense to use schema version.\r\n- Introduce a SchemaProvider which returns a specific schema instance for a given schema version\r\n- Implement a MultiVersionGenericRecordSchema which decode the messages based on schema version. All the records\r\n  decoded by this schema will have schema version and its corresponding schema definitions.\r\n\r\n*NOTES\r\n\r\nThis implementation only introduce the mechanism.

But they shaded the dependencies independently.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common to see applications using both pulsar-client and pulsar-client-admin. These applications will have redundant shaded classes existed in both pulsar-client and pulsar-client-admin. Sometime it also causes troubles when we introduced new dependencies but forget to update shading rules.\r\n\r\n*Modifications*\r\n\r\nThis proposal is proposing introduced a new module called pulsar-client-all. It will include both pulsar-client and pulsar-client-admin and shade the dependencies only one time. This would reduce the size of dependencies for applications using both pulsar-client and pulsar-client-admin.",

First and foremost, they both use different versions of the Hadoop-client library. And secondly, the HDFS2 version creates the FSDataOutputStream object directly, whereas the HDFS3 version leverages the FSDataOutputStreamBuilder class for this purpose, as it is the preferred method going forward.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nThere will be be support for connecting to both 2.x and 3.x version of HDFS. However, there MAY BE some library conflicts in the released jar due to the different versions of the same library in the different modules. Hopefully the NAR packaging will address this.",

Occasionally, the following error occurs and client authentication fails.\r\n\r\n> [pulsar-web-28-7] ERROR com.yahoo.athenz.auth.token.Token - Token:validate: token=v=Z1;d=xxx;r=xxx;p=xxx;a=xxx;t=1544027514;e=1544034714;k=0;i=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : has future timestamp=1544027514 : current time=1544027513 : allowed offset=0\r\n\r\nThis means that the timestamp included in the authentication token is more future than the server time. Since the difference between them is only 1 second, I think that the time of either server or client is slightly off.\r\n\r\nThis error can be avoided by increasing the value of `allowed offset`. Currently, this value is set to 0 in Pulsar, but the default value in Athenz ZMS seems to be 300 seconds.\r\nhttps://github.com/yahoo/athenz/blob/93fe62c17f3ab4556c71c5136c1646df4a874a5f/servers/zms/conf/zms.properties#L277-L280\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Changed the default value of `allowed offset` from 0 to 30 (I think 300 seconds is too long)\r\n* Enabled specifying `allowed offset` using system property\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nEven if the time of the server or client is slightly off, the authentication will succeed.",

Added parameters:\r\n```\r\n// Enable region-aware bookie selection policy.

Fixed bug in ZkBookieRackAffinityMapping: the value set to racksWithHost by deserialize() was overriden by the affectation in setConf().

        "message": "Allow non-pesistent topics to be retrieved along with persistent ones from the \"GetTopicsOfNamespace\" method (#2025)\n\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPlease see issue #2009 for a detailed bug report.\r\n\r\nIn our use case we require using java client with pattern subscription to read from a set of non-persistent topics. Unfortunately, right now this feature doesn't work. After researching the cause for this I have found out that under the hood the client is requesting a list of topics by namespace from the server and then filters them out by pattern and subscribes to them. The method in Pulsar broker NamespaceService class that is responsible for searching for required topics only uses ledgers, thus returning only persistent topics to the client. The goal of this pull request is to provide a solution for that problem.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates `getListOfTopics` method of NamespaceService class to also include active non-pesistent topics from local broker cache inside the `multiLayerTopicsMap` collection of BrokerService in the result.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nAs a result, requesting a list of topics by namespace using the HTTP API or binary API (and thus via the clients) will add non-persistent topics to search result, allowing pattern subscription to be used with non-persistent topics.\r\n\r\n### Considerations\r\n\r\n1. Since this method pulls non-persistent topics from local broker cache, this probably means that this solution will only work for Pulsar installations with a single broker. And if there are multiple brokers, results might be inconsistent. Unfortunately I don't really know if non-persistent themselves work in multi-broker setups. I have recently asked on Slack if non-persistent topics are being replicated in any way and @merlimat's response was that they don't. Also it seems to be that some other methods that are working with non-persistent topics are using this very same collection.\r\n\r\n2. It seems to me that unit tests have made sure that Java client can work with this setup, but this might still be a breaking change for other clients or if applications working with this API are not expecting non-persistent topics in result.\r\n\r\n3. I have made sure that old unit tests inside the `pulsar-broker` subproject are still working and updated some old tests for this particular use case. Are there any more tests that I can add.\r\n\r\nOverall, we really need this and I would appreciate if maintainers could share their opinion. Thanks in advance.",

Currently, the presto pulsar connector will read synchronously from bookkeeper when it has run out of entries go process.  Basically, we process a batch of entries and then we read more.  Ideally should be doing reading and processing in parallel to increase throughput.\r\n\r\n2. Each split initializes their own ManagedLedgerFactory/Bookkeeper client.  We really just need one bookkeeper client to be shared among threads.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n1. Rewrote the logic in the Presto Pulsar connector to read async and process in parallel\r\n\r\n2. Cache ManagedLedgerFactory to be used across splits\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nI see about 2X throughput improvement on single node as well as cluster (2 brokers, 3 bookies, 4 presto workers including coordinator) on AWS",

        "message": " [tiered storage] Use NAR plugin to package offloaders  (#2393)\n\n\r\n ### Motivation\r\n\r\nOffloader typically involves a new storage system, which usually involves dependencies that\r\nmight be conflicting with the dependencies of Pulsar. We want to package offloader implementations\r\nas what we did for connectors, so people can decide which offloader to use and only include it.\r\nPeople would also become easier to write its offloader if needed.\r\n\r\n ### Changes\r\n\r\n- Update `tiered-storage/jcloud` to package it using nifi-nar plugin.\r\n- Add bunch of utils in managed-ledger to locate offloader nar packages and load `LedgerOffloaderFactory` from corresponding NAR package.\r\n- Add a new distribution module to package offloaders into one distribution, as what we did for connectors.\r\n- Update pulsar-all image to include offloaders\r\n\r\n ### NOTES\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't get rid of jcloud-shaded. because jcloud is using `ServiceLoad` and Guice injection. It makes\r\nthings very tricky on class loading. Not attempt to address the problem any time soon. We can pin `jcloud-shaded` version\r\nas what we did for `protobuf-shaded` in next release.",

We might potentially cause data loss.\r\n\r\n2) The location of an offloaded ledger is needed by Pulsar SQL. so it is very inconvinient to\r\nhave the location information stored in a configuration and the approach is also problematic.\r\n\r\n ### Changes\r\n\r\nStore `driverName` and driver-specific metadata (e.g. bucket name, region name, endpoint) in the\r\noriginal ledger metadata. Change ManagedLedgerImpl to use the driver-specific metadata to read\r\nthe offloaded ledger. If the driver-specific metadata is missed, it will fall back to use the configuration.\r\n\r\n ### Tests\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't change the behavior. Existing unit tests and integration tests already covered the logic.\r\n\r\n ### NOTES\r\n\r\nCurrently the driver name in metadata is not used. We need to use driver name to load different offloader driver\r\nafter #2393 is implemented",

The race happens when the maps gets re-hashed after the expansion and the new arrays are substituting the old ones.\r\n\r\nThe race itself is that a thread doing a `get()` on the map is first checking the current capacity of the map, uses that to get the bucket and then tries to do optimistic read of the value in that bucket.\r\n\r\nThis assumes `capacity` update is visible only after the `values` array is already swapped, but that is not always the case in current code.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n * Use `volatile` qualifier for `capacity` and `values` arrays to ensure ordering of memory read is respected by compiler\r\n * In rehashing, update `capacity` after `values` where it was not already the case",

PULSAR_MEM is set to very high (~2G). If we start more than 6 containers, it will quickly go up to ~12GB.\r\n2. We start containers for each tests, which is very inefficient.\r\n3. There is a regression from #2214. #2214 tried to listen on a hostname that is configured in worker config,\r\n  which the hostname is internally to docker environment.\r\n\r\n ### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Set PULSAR_MEM to use no more than 128M.\r\n2. Switch to use test suite, trying to start containers only once as possible and use them across test suites.\r\n   so we only start the cluster for a set of tests. hence reorganize those tests and get rid\r\n   of using dataProvider, which doesn't work well with current approach.\r\n3. Remove binding to hostname in WorkerServer, so it binds to all interfaces.\r\n\r\n* remove suite xml\r\n\r\n* Avoid running testng suites multiple times",
